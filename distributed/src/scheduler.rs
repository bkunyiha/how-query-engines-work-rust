//! Port of `kquery/distributed/src/main/kotlin/Scheduler.kt`.
//!
//! Defines [`ExecutorClient`] — the trait that abstracts the Arrow Flight
//! transport — and [`Scheduler`], which orchestrates stage-by-stage execution
//! of a distributed query plan.
//!
//! ## Shape — sequential by design
//! Stages run in dependency order; tasks within a stage are dispatched
//! one-at-a-time round-robin across executors. No async, no Tokio, no rayon.
//! This matches kquery's deliberate simplicity (the module is a teaching
//! artifact, not a production scheduler). Concurrency lives one layer up at
//! the Flight boundary (`flight-server` / `client`).
//!
//! ## Translation note — `ExecutorClient` is the seam to Flight
//! The trait has three methods (`execute_task`, `execute_final_task`,
//! `fetch_shuffle`); this crate ships the trait but not a real implementation.
//! `MockExecutorClient` in tests proves the scheduler is exercisable without
//! Flight. The real implementation lands with module 13 (`flight-server` /
//! `client`).
