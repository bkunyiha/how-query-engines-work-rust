//! Port of `kquery/physical-plan/src/main/kotlin/ScanExec.kt`.
//!
//! Scans a data source with an optional push-down projection. It is the only leaf
//! operator: it has no child plan and produces its batches by delegating to the
//! `DataSource` (which the optimizer's `ProjectionPushDownRule` has already
//! trimmed to just the columns the query needs).
