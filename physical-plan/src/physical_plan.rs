//! Port of `kquery/physical-plan/src/main/kotlin/PhysicalPlan.kt`.
//!
//! A physical plan is an executable piece of code that produces data. It is the
//! runtime counterpart of a [`logical_plan::LogicalPlan`]: the logical plan says
//! *what* to compute, the physical plan says *how* and actually runs it.
//!
//! ## Translation note — trait, not enum (ARCHITECTURE.md §4.6)
//! Everywhere else in this port a Kotlin interface with a closed implementor set
//! becomes a Rust `enum` (§3.1 — see `logical_plan::LogicalPlan`, which has six
//! variants). `PhysicalPlan` is the documented exception. The physical layer is
//! the largest module in the workspace (28 Kotlin files) and the operator set is
//! *open in spirit*: adding a new operator should mean adding a new file, not
//! editing a central enum and every `match` over it. The Kotlin source models
//! this with inheritance (`class ProjectionExec : PhysicalPlan`), so the faithful
//! Rust port uses a **trait** referenced through `Arc<dyn PhysicalPlan>` — same
//! shape as DataFusion's `Arc<dyn ExecutionPlan>`. The deviation is intentional
//! and recorded in `TRANSLATION_NOTES.md`.
//!
//! ## Translation note — `Sequence` → `Box<dyn Iterator>`
//! Kotlin's `execute(): Sequence<RecordBatch>` is a lazy stream. The Rust analogue
//! is a boxed iterator, `Box<dyn Iterator<Item = RecordBatch>>`. (A future async
//! rewrite would return a `futures::Stream`; this faithful port stays synchronous,
//! matching the Kotlin shape.)
//!
//! ## Translation note — `Arc<dyn PhysicalPlan>`, not `Box<dyn PhysicalPlan>`
//! Every operator with an input field — `ProjectionExec`, `SelectionExec`,
//! `LimitExec`, `HashAggregateExec`, `HashJoinExec`, `ShuffleWriterExec` —
//! stores its child as `Arc<dyn PhysicalPlan>`. This is the structural
//! precondition for the `DistributedPlanner` / `as_any` rewrite shape and
//! for the `with_new_children` trait method below. The argument in one
//! breath:
//!
//! `Box<dyn PhysicalPlan>` is uniquely owned and `dyn PhysicalPlan` is not
//! `Clone` (trait objects aren't `Sized`, so `Clone: Sized` excludes them).
//! `box_field.clone()` therefore does not compile. The only ways to use a
//! Box-owned child without consuming the parent are to move out of the
//! parent (destroying its identity at compile time) or to deep-clone the
//! whole subtree (requires a workspace-wide deep-clone trait). Both
//! rejected.
//!
//! `Arc<dyn PhysicalPlan>` is shared via an atomic refcount.
//! `arc_field.clone()` compiles and bumps the refcount by one atomic op —
//! no deep copy, no new operator instance, both Arcs point at the same
//! heap value. The `DistributedPlanner` accesses operators through
//! borrowed `&HashAggregateExec` views returned by
//! `plan.as_any().downcast_ref::<HashAggregateExec>()`; it can therefore
//! produce owned children for newly-constructed operators by Arc-cloning
//! the fields it needs (`agg.input.clone()`, `agg.group_expr.clone()`,
//! `agg.aggregate_expr.clone()`) while leaving the original aggregate
//! fully readable for the next step in the rewrite chain.
//!
//! This matches DataFusion's `Arc<dyn ExecutionPlan>` shape exactly. See
//! `ARCHITECTURE.md` §4.6 ("Why `Arc`, not `Box`, for child fields") for
//! the worked walkthrough and the call-site code.
//!
//! ## Translation note — `Send + Sync` for parallel execution (Module 8)
//! `PhysicalPlan` (and its sibling expression traits) require `Send + Sync`.
//! Kotlin's `ParallelContext` runs partial aggregates on multiple workers via
//! coroutines (`runBlocking { async { … } }`); the faithful Rust substitution is
//! `rayon` (ARCHITECTURE.md §3.9). rayon moves work onto a worker pool, so every
//! value a worker touches — the `Arc<dyn PhysicalPlan>` it runs and the
//! `Arc<dyn Expression>` / `Arc<dyn AggregateExpression>` it shares — must be
//! `Send + Sync`. Adding the bound here propagates to `Expression`,
//! `AggregateExpression` (physical-plan) and `DataSource` (datasource). It is
//! satisfied automatically: every operator/expression holds only `Send + Sync`
//! data (arrow `ArrayRef = Arc<dyn Array>` is `Send + Sync`, and the structs carry
//! `Arc`/`Box` of these same traits plus plain data). The bound is also a
//! prerequisite for the distributed/Flight modules (13–15), which serve batches
//! across threads. `ColumnVector` and `Accumulator` deliberately do *not* gain the
//! bound — their trait objects are created and consumed inside a single worker and
//! never cross a thread boundary.
