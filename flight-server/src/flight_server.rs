//! Port of `kquery/flight-server/src/main/kotlin/io/FlightServer.kt`.
//!
//! Contains the [`serve`] function — the library-side entry point that wires
//! up a tonic gRPC server around an [`RQueryFlightProducer`] and binds it to a
//! TCP address. The runnable `main()` (the Kotlin `FlightServer.main` shim)
//! lives in `src/bin/flight_server.rs`, which calls [`serve`].
//!
//! ## Why this split (lib + bin)
//! Keeping the bind/serve loop in the library lets integration tests
//! start the server on a random port (`0.0.0.0:0`) without going
//! through the binary. The binary itself stays a thin shim around `serve`,
//! the same way kquery's `FlightServer.kt` is a thin shim around its
//! `FlightServer.Builder.build().start()` call.
